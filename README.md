Reinforcement Learning for Atari Breakout Game

An agent is trained to play the Atari Breakout game. The game environment is set up by the gym library. The Deep-Q-Network algorithm from the stable_baselines library was used to perform the training. The simulation was run in the free GPU resource of Google Colab. https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb#recent=true
